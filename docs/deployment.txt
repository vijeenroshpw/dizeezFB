                                                Deploymer's Document 

                                   Author: Vijeenrosh P.W <hsorhteeniv@gmail.com>

Preface:
---------
The documentation describes how to deploy the game . This document can be used as a reference for setting up localy for testing/hacking
as well as for deploying . 


a) Getting and Setting Necessary App Parameters
------------------------------------------------
 Being a facebook game, the first thing is to create a facebook canvas app . If you have not already signed up as a facebook 
 developer, you can signup as developer at following link :
   
   https://developers.facebook.com/
 
 and Hence probably being first time here I recommend reading the FB developer docs for knowing more about FB games , and various
 critical game parameters.

 For ones who have already registered as a developer , can create a new app by clicking   'Create New App' .

 Now you have created a new app Please take note of the following parameters of the app :
 
 APP_ID     : the id of the application
 APP_SECRET : A secret key of the app 

 ACCESS_TOKEN : This parameter have to be generated by a get request to following uri 
  
   GET /oauth/access_token? client_id={app-id}&client_secret={app-secret}&grant_type=client_credentials
   
 Take not of the access token . 
 
 
 b) Setting up the database 
 --------------------------
 You have two options over here 
   1) MySQL database 
    --------------
    The .sql file is  assets/master.sql . You can load it to your database by any means 
    eg:  mysql -u uname -p password dbasename < master.sql 
    or by using source query in MySQL    : SOURCE master.sql

   2) SQLite Database
    ---------------
    Fairly straight forward,     assets/dbase.db is the sqlite database file. Nothing has to be loaded 

 
    

c) The config file 
---------------------
docs/config_format.py gives the format of the config file. Its fairly straight forward here , every thing is documented there . Set up the 
necessary parameters as mentioned. 

  (NOTE: database username,password ,dbname  is necessary only for MySQL case. for the SQLITE case leave those blank,
   and modifiy the CONNECTION_URI parameter to  "sqlite:///../assets/dbase.db"  )
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  ADMIN_PASS :  " The password to the admin interface,set a password here "
  ACHIEVEMENT_DOMAIN : " This is the domain where you achievements are registered ,We will talk about this later leave it blank for now"

then rename this file as  config.py and place it in the services/ directory
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

d) Installing Python dependencies 
----------------------------------
In this step we will install python dependencies. It can be done 

pip install -r requirements/required_packages.txt 

requirements/required_packages.txt contains all necessary dependencies for the app, EXCEPT MySQLdb . You have to manually install 
MySQLdb in case you are using MySQL as database 



e) Going back to the Facebook App settings
------------------------------------------
Shoot back to the Facebook App setting , we have some work to do there  :
  
  1) setting canvas , and secure canvas url parameters
      
      If you are testing localy , you can set the parameters as 
        http://localhost:5000/     
        https://localhost:5000/                  #- assuming running on port 5000
      
  2) Set the app category as game .



If you have hosted the app on a domain then ,   the canvas , secure canvas urls should be varied accordingly.

f) Running the app 
--------------------
Now navigate to the services/ directory 

user@machine$ python app.py 

and the app starts running -:)




g) Achievements Registering
----------------------------
This step is for Registering the achievement urls . For this to work you have to host the app on some domain .
For this part I suggest going through the Facebook Achievemens APi 
Our achievemtns uri's are   /achieves/1-8
